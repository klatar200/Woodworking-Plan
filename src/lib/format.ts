 * THERE IS NO `formatCents`. THERE IS NO `formatCostRange`. THIS IS DELIBERATE.
 *
 * DECISIONS_LOG.md 2026-07-13: the public UI shows COST TIERS ONLY — $ through $$$$$
 * — and no dollar figures anywhere. Not on cards, not on plan pages, not in the
 * materials table, not on the shopping list, not in print.
 *
 * WHY THE FUNCTIONS ARE DELETED RATHER THAN MERELY UNUSED: a formatter that exists
 * will eventually get called. Removing it makes the rule STRUCTURAL — you cannot
 * render a dollar amount, because there is nothing to render it with. That is worth
 * more than a comment asking people not to.
 *
 * WHY: an itemized dollar total is a CLAIM OF PRECISION WE CANNOT SUPPORT. Lumber
 * varies by region, species and season, and every figure in the catalog is a
 * hand-authored ballpark. A tier communicates the same decision-relevant fact — "this
 * is a cheap project" vs "this is not" — and cannot be wrong in the way a number can.
 *
 * `Material.costCents`, `Plan.costMinCents` and `Plan.costMaxCents` REMAIN in the
 * schema and remain populated. They are the INPUT that derives the tier. This is a
 * presentation decision, not a data decision — deleting the underlying numbers would
 * be a one-way door and would make the tiers unmaintainable.

 *
 * The old version was `'$'.repeat(indexOf(tier) + 1)`. For an unrecognized tier
 * `indexOf` returns -1, `repeat(0)` returns `''`, and the page renders **an empty
 * string where the cost should be** — no error, no warning, just a missing price band
 * that nobody notices in review.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: it happened. A test fixture was missing its `costTier` and
 * the print view rendered `<dd> of $$$$$</dd>`. The assertion caught it, but only
 * because it checked for an exact string; a laxer test would have passed against a page
 * that silently shows no cost at all.
 *
 * Now the cost tier is the ONLY cost signal in the entire UI (dollar figures are gone —
 * see below), so silently rendering nothing is no longer a cosmetic bug. Throw instead:
 * a missing tier is a data bug, and it should be impossible to ship one quietly.
